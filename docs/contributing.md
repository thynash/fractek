## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Development Setup

Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thynash/fractek.git
cd fractek

Create a development environment
python -m venv fractek-dev
source fractek-dev/bin/activate # Windows: fractek-dev\Scripts\activate

Install in development mode with test dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

Verify installation
python -c "import fractek; print(fractek.version)"


### 2. Development Dependencies

pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

This includes:
- `pytest` - Testing framework
- `black` - Code formatting
- `flake8` - Code linting
- `mypy` - Type checking
- `sphinx` - Documentation generation
- `jupyter` - Interactive development and examples

---

## üìù Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

### 2. Make Your Changes

Follow these guidelines:
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow our coding standards (see below)

### 3. Test Your Changes

Run the full test suite
pytest

Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_fractals.py
pytest tests/test_noise.py
pytest tests/test_visualization.py

Check code formatting
black --check .
flake8 .

Type checking
mypy fractek/


### 4. Submit a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your fork
2. Create a pull request with a clear title and description
3. Link any related issues
4. Wait for review and address feedback

## üéØ Coding Standards

### Code Style

We use **Black** for code formatting and **flake8** for linting:

Format code
black .

Check linting
flake8 .



### Key Principles

- **Readability first**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Mathematical accuracy**: Implement algorithms faithfully to mathematical definitions
- **Performance awareness**: Consider computational complexity and memory usage
- **Modular design**: Keep functions focused and classes cohesive
- **Error handling**: Provide clear error messages and handle edge cases

### Documentation Standards

- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions and classes
- **Type hints**: Include type annotations for function parameters and returns
- **Examples**: Provide usage examples in docstrings where helpful


---

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Mirror the package structure: `tests/test_fractals.py` for `fractek/fractals.py`
- Use descriptive test names: `test_mandelbrot_set_generates_correct_shape()`

### Test Categories

Unit tests - test individual functions
def test_mandelbrot_point_calculation():
"""Test Mandelbrot iteration for a single point."""

Integration tests - test module interactions
def test_fractal_visualization_pipeline():
"""Test complete fractal generation and visualization."""

Mathematical validation tests
def test_hausdorff_dimension_known_fractals():
"""Test dimension calculation against known theoretical values."""


### Writing Good Tests

- **Test edge cases**: Empty inputs, boundary conditions, extreme values
- **Validate mathematical properties**: Known theoretical results, symmetries
- **Use fixtures**: Share setup code between related tests
- **Assert with precision**: Use appropriate tolerances for floating-point comparisons

import pytest
import numpy as np

def test_koch_snowflake_area_convergence():
"""Test that Koch snowflake area converges to expected value."""
snowflake = koch_snowflake(iterations=10)
expected_area = (2 * np.sqrt(3) / 5) * (initial_triangle_area)

assert abs(snowflake.area - expected_area) < 1e-10

## üìö Documentation Guidelines

### Writing Documentation

- **Clear and concise**: Explain concepts without unnecessary jargon
- **Visual examples**: Include fractal images and plots where relevant
- **Mathematical context**: Provide theoretical background when helpful
- **Code examples**: Show practical usage with expected outputs

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

Include the following information:
- **Fractek version** and Python version
- **Operating system** and environment details
- **Minimal code example** that reproduces the issue
- **Expected vs. actual behavior**
- **Error messages** and stack traces (if any)

### Feature Requests

- **Clear description** of the proposed feature
- **Use case explanation** - why would this be useful?
- **Mathematical background** (for algorithm requests)
- **Implementation ideas** (if you have them)
