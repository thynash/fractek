# fractek â€” Modular Fractal Mathematics, Visualization, and Analysis Library

Welcome to **fractek**, a world-class Python library that offers a comprehensive, modular toolkit for generating, visualizing, and analyzing fractals and fractal noise. Designed with scientific rigor and creative flexibility, fractek empowers researchers, developers, and artists to explore the fascinating universe of fractals with ease and power.

### Why fractek?

Fractals lie at the intersection of mathematics, nature, and art, revealing complex patterns from simple rules. fractek brings cutting-edge fractal mathematics algorithms and visualization capabilities together in one unified, extensible platform:

* Generate classic fractal sets like Mandelbrot and Julia with customizable parameters.
* Create fractal noise textures that simulate natural phenomena.
* Perform fractal dimension and multifractal spectrum analyses.
* Visualize results in interactive and publication-quality plots.
* Modular design allows easy extension with new fractal families or analysis methods.

### Quickstart Example

```python
import fractek
from fractek.fractal_families.classic import mandelbrot

# Generate a Mandelbrot set image
mandel = mandelbrot.mandelbrot_set(xmin=-2, xmax=1, ymin=-1.5, ymax=1.5, width=256, height=256, max_iter=50)
print(mandel)  # NumPy array representing iterations
```

Explore various fractal families, noise generators, and visualization tools through an intuitive API.
